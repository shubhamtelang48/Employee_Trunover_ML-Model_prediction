# Employee_Trunover_ML-Model_prediction
In this ML model we study on what factors contributed most to employees turnover in a company and predict that is the employee left the company or not.
Any company in the world doesn't want that the employees will left the company because of salary,enviornment and other reasons.
In a sense,it's the employee who make the company and it's the employee who works for company,so employee is most important for the companies growth.
